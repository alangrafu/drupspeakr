Manual Installation
--------------------

* Download the source or clone the repository from http://github.com/alangrafu/lodspeakr

* Edit settings.default.inc.php and change the following values:
** $conf['endpoint']['host']     Point to the SPARQL endpoint with your data
** $conf['basedir']              The base URL in which slopds will be locations (e.g., http://example.org, http://example.com/data)
** $conf['ns']['local'] 		 Defines your local namespace
*** If you want, you can add more namespaces as  $conf['ns']['myns']    = 'http://namespacesite.com/'
** $conf['home']                 Defines where is LODSPeaKr located (i.e., /var/www/html/mydata/lodspeakr)

Give write permissions to your http server on cache/ and meta/ dirs as well as meta/db.sqlite database.
This can be done in different ways depending on your configuration.

* If you are in ther same group as the httpd user
** chmod -R g+w cache meta
* If you want to assign those dirs to your webserver
** sudo chown -R www-apache meta cache

NOTE: You must check what is the name of the user for your server. Common names are
* www
* www-apache
* apache2
* httpd


That's it. You should be able to serve your data in RDF/XML, Turtle, Ntriples and RDFa.
